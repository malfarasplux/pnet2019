Implementation of grid_search ESN loop instead of bash calls
In principle, using nan to zero
Need to generate reports iteratively
Aimed at running in 1664 VM Google cloud
Might need to work with full paths rather than relative
Aimed at extending grid search ranges (N, scale, mem)
Should be capable of exploring nanfill, backwards and no-interpolation scenarios
In principle, F1 based (possibility to remove threshold study and base CV upon AUC)

/pnet2019/ESN_CV_v2_extended used as a base

#Copied from ESNtools_v2
Aug 17 Performing an AB CV grid_search
patient had to be flatten
ESNpp: ESN per patient

Attempt to implement an ESN that fills up for every new patient
(iteratively)
(1) Allocate full ESN: Local (Train, Test*)
(2) Not allocate full ESN: Physionet official Test --> last current line makes the prediction

ESNtools remain the same
ESNtrain and test must change
Need to place CV changes in Train and Test versions

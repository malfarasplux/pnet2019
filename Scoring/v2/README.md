# Instructions

The Python script `evaluate_sepsis_score.py` evaluates predictions on the input data.

To run this script, install the NumPy Python package and run

        python evaluate_sepsis_score.py training.zip predictions.zip scores.psv

which takes `training.zip` (a zip file of the training data files, which is available on the PhysioNet website) and `predictions.zip` (a zip file of the prediction files) as input and returns `scores.psv` as output.

#Copied from ESNtools_v2
Aug 17 Performing an AB CV grid_search
patient had to be flatten
ESNpp: ESN per patient

Attempt to implement an ESN that fills up for every new patient
(iteratively)
(1) Allocate full ESN: Local (Train, Test*)
(2) Not allocate full ESN: Physionet official Test --> last current line makes the prediction

ESNtools remain the same
ESNtrain and test must change
Need to place CV changes in Train and Test versions

# Instructions

The MATLAB script `get_sepsis_score.m` makes predictions on the input data.

To run this script, open MATLAB and run

        matlab(get_sepsis_score, training.zip, predictions.zip)

which takes `training.zip` (a zip file of the training data files, which is available on the PhysioNet website) as input and returns `predictions.zip` (a zip file of the prediction files) as output.
